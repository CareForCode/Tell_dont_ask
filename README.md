# Tell, Don't Ask!
This is a repository I created for a blog post about "Tell, Don't Ask" (TDA) at https://careforcode.com/

I wrote this code to show how you can use TDA to increase the encapsulation of your code.
The repository you see here is just a sample and should not be seen as a real implementation of a super mario game.
This is a very simple and short example on how to use TDA

Additionally to the main branch, you will find two more branches, that show the code after refactoring it.
The first iteration is about using the TDA to take the logic from the game class and move it into the mario class.
The second iteration shows the code after cleaning up a bit more.

Either way, if you wanny try it out, or just look at my perspective, I hope you take something out of it!
