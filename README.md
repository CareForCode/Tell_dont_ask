# Tell, Don't Ask!
This is a repository I created for a blog post about "Tell, Don't Ask" (TDA) at https://careforcode.com/

I wrote this code to show how you can use TDA to increase the encapsulation of your code.
The repository you see here is just a sample of a super mario game. 

In here you will find a game and a mario class. 
In the main branch, the game class manages everything while the mario class is just there to hold its state and give it to the game class.
In the first iteration branch, I used TDA to move the necessary logic from the game class to the mario class.
In the second iteration branch, I cleaned up, so the code is much more readable.

Either way, if you wanny try it out, or just look at my perspective, I hope you take something out of it!
